After spending a week in the lovely country of Portugal with my mom, I have been blessed with the opportunity to spend six weeks doing Data Science. The past week, I ventured to Douro Valley and Lisbon at two magnificent hotels called Six Senses and The One Palacio de Anunciades. We walked all over Lisbon, ate delicious pastries, and traveled to Sintra.
